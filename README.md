Provides automatic image tagging for TYPO3 via Deep Learning

## State

***!!! Currently this extension is under development and not ready to be used in any way !!!***

The extension will hopefully be released in early may 2020.

## What it _will_ provide

The main goal is to automatically tag images uploaded into typo3 with relevant tags in sys_category.

The tags will probably be given based on what the Deep Model learns from samples taken from Pixabay. This means that it is to be expected that tags will very much look like the tags that you can find on images at Pixabay.

There are no plans to make it possible for editors to create their own tags to be used by the extension. Instead the extension will create tags automatically as they are needed.

_Maybe_ there will be a possibility and _maybe even_ a tutorial to customize the model so it can specifically meet the demands of a specific website.
